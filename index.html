            <h1>Burnham Park</h1>
            <p>
            Burnham Park was envisioned by American rchitect Daniel Hudson Burnham as part of a larger plan for the city of Baguio in 1905. After having presented the preliminary plans for Baguio and the capital city of Manila, Burnham left the task of interpreting such plans to William E. Parsons. The area where Burnham Park is situated was formerly known as 'Baguio Meadow".

            Burnham's role in establishing the park is cknowledged through a bust bearing his likeness and a plaque located at one end of the park.
                
            The park's design is influenced from the City Beautiful movement; It has a small pond or lagoon situated at the green space's center and has regimented rows of grass and sidewalk. According to the Baguio Heritage Foundation in 2014, only the open field often used for football and the Melvin Jones Grandstand adhere to Burnham's original design for the park.

            <h1>Botanical Garden</h1>
            <p>
            The garden, which was previously a zoo, was renamed to the Imelda Park by Ferdinand Marcos for his wife in 1970.
            The park has art galleries provided by the Baguio Arts Guild, and sculptures displaying the culture of the Igorot people. A statue by Ben Hur Villanueva commemorating the people who built Baguio can also be found.

            The park also contains a friendship garden featuring the countries United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Thailand, which contain elements of the country's culture, such as temples and statues. It also contains a sunflower farm and gardens spotlighting Dahlia, cactuses, marguerites, orchids, and succulents.

            One of the garden's main attractions is a 150 m (490 ft) long tunnel which was dug out by Japanese Imperial Army soldiers during World War II for use as storage, treatment, and a bunker.

            <p>
            Strawberry farming in Benguet, Philippines, is a significant agricultural activity due to the region's favorable climate and soil conditions. Benguet is located in the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Philippines and is known for its cool climate, which is suitable for growing strawberries.

            <p>
            Founded in 1907 in Baguio City, Philippines, the Mirador Jesuit Villa Retreat House has endured the tests of time. Severely damaged during World War II and subsequently rebuilt in the 1950s, it remains a spiritual haven for many Filipino Catholics. The Lourdes Grotto on Mirador Hill, a pilgrimage site for thousands of faithful over the decades, was officially declared an Important Cultural Property by the National Museum of the Philippines, adding to its significance as a spiritual and cultural landmark.
            Recently undergoing renovations, Mirador Jesuit Villa now offers an enhanced space for reflection and prayer. The newly introduced Heritage & Eco-Spirituality Park boasts various features, including a massive limestone rock formation, a bamboo grove, Ignatian and Biblical-themed gardens showcasing Philippine plants (many indigenous to Baguio), Cordilleran motif gardens, and two Memorial Monuments—one commemorating the end of World War II’s 75th anniversary and the other acknowledging the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
